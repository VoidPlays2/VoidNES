VoidNES is a silly little project I made which allows you to play Nintendo Entertainment System ROMs in the VR game Gorilla Tag.

Although the core is NesSharp, I have been studying the 6502 CPU and sometimes make funny stuff in 6502 assembly to learn about it.

This was a fun thing to make and I might make more.
